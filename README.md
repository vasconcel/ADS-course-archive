# Analysis & Development of Systems

## Overview

Repository serving as a central index for projects and learning materials developed during the [Analysis & Development of Systems](https://www.ufca.edu.br/cursos/graduacao/ads/) course at the [Universidade Federal do Cariri (UFCA)](https://www.ufca.edu.br/). The curriculum covers diverse areas of computing, including algorithms, programming logic, databases, web & mobile development, software engineering concepts, and project management.

## Structure_&_Access

This repository acts as a hub. Detailed notes, documentation, activities, syllabus information, and supplementary materials for each discipline are organized and maintained externally on **Notion**. The links provided below in the semester sections grant direct access to these dedicated Notion pages.

*(Note: Notion links are currently placeholders [Notion Page - TBD] as content migration is in progress.)*

## Semester_Breakdown

Content is grouped by academic semester for clarity and ease of navigation. Each section lists the disciplines undertaken during that period, linking to their respective Notion workspaces.

*   [Integrated Project Hub (Notion)]([Notion Page - TBD])

## Directory_Schema_Illustration

While primary content resides on Notion, this repository might host project code or specific artifacts. The general structure aims for clarity:

# Analysis & Development of Systems @ UFCA
*A Personal Learning Compendium & Navigation Hub*

## Purpose & Approach

This repository serves as the **central navigation hub** for my coursework, notes, and projects from the **Analysis & Development of Systems (ADS)** program at the **Universidade Federal do Cariri (UFCA)**.

The comprehensive, detailed content ‚Äì including notes, summaries, activities, syllabi, and learning reflections ‚Äì is meticulously organized and maintained externally on **Notion**. This structure keeps this repository clean and focused solely on providing clear entry points to the structured knowledge base.

**The primary goal is to facilitate efficient review and retrieval of information studied across the semesters.**

## Repository Content Note

This GitHub repository primarily acts as an index. **Detailed notes, explanations, and most code examples reside on Notion.** Specific, larger code artifacts, especially for Integrated Projects, *may* be hosted here in dedicated subdirectories for version control purposes, but Notion remains the primary source of truth for coursework.
